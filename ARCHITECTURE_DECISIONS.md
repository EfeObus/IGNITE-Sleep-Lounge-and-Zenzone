# Architecture Decision Records

This document captures the architectural decisions made for the IGNITE Sleep Lounge and Zen Zone application. Each decision is documented to provide context and rationale.

## ADR-001: Full Stack JavaScript Application

**Date**: December 20, 2024

**Status**: Accepted

**Context**: 
We needed to select a technology stack for the IGNITE Sleep Lounge and Zen Zone application that would allow rapid development, ease of maintenance, and good performance.

**Decision**: 
Use a full JavaScript stack with Node.js/Express.js for the backend and vanilla JavaScript for the frontend.

**Rationale**:
1. Single language throughout the stack simplifies development and maintenance
2. JavaScript's asynchronous nature works well for our real-time requirements
3. Express.js provides a lightweight framework with robust middleware ecosystem
4. Avoiding frontend frameworks reduces complexity for this relatively simple UI
5. Development team has strong JavaScript expertise

**Consequences**:
* Positive: Faster development time
* Positive: Easier to find developers familiar with the stack
* Positive: Good support for WebSockets for real-time features
* Negative: May require more manual optimization for performance
* Negative: Manual DOM manipulation can become complex

## ADR-002: PostgreSQL Database

**Date**: January 5, 2025

**Status**: Accepted

**Context**: 
The application requires a robust database to store student records, visit logs, and system configuration.

**Decision**: 
Use PostgreSQL as the primary database with Sequelize as the ORM.

**Rationale**:
1. PostgreSQL provides strong ACID compliance needed for student and visit records
2. Advanced data types and query capabilities support our reporting needs
3. Sequelize ORM provides a structured way to interact with the database
4. Good scalability characteristics for future growth
5. Excellent community support and documentation

**Consequences**:
* Positive: Robust data integrity guarantees

## ADR-003: JWT Authentication

**Date**: January 15, 2025

**Status**: Accepted

**Context**: 
We need a secure authentication mechanism for staff and admin users that works well with our stateless API.

**Decision**: 
Implement JWT (JSON Web Token) based authentication with role-based access control.

**Rationale**:
1. JWTs enable stateless authentication which simplifies scaling
2. Role-based claims in tokens can control access to different API endpoints
3. Token expiration provides security benefits
4. Works well with our Express.js backend
5. Can include campus and service information directly in the token

**Consequences**:
* Positive: Simplified authorization checks
* Positive: No need for session storage on the server
* Positive: Good compatibility with our API structure
* Negative: Requires careful management of JWT secrets
* Negative: Cannot invalidate specific tokens without additional mechanisms

## ADR-004: Real-time Updates with WebSockets

**Date**: February 1, 2025

**Status**: Accepted

**Context**: 
Staff need real-time updates on bed/station availability and student check-in/check-out events.

**Decision**: 
Implement WebSocket connections for real-time communication from server to client.

**Rationale**:
1. WebSockets provide low-latency, bi-directional communication
2. Real-time updates improve staff workflow efficiency
3. Helps maintain accurate status displays for all staff
4. Socket.io library provides good abstraction and fallback mechanisms
5. Works well with our Node.js backend

**Consequences**:
* Positive: Immediate updates to all connected clients
* Positive: Reduces need for frequent polling
* Positive: Better user experience for staff
* Negative: Adds complexity to server implementation
* Negative: Requires maintaining socket connections

## ADR-005: Modular Architecture with Clear Separation of Concerns

**Date**: February 10, 2025

**Status**: Accepted

**Context**: 
We need a maintainable code structure that allows for future expansion and modifications.

**Decision**: 
Adopt a modular architecture with clear separation between routes, controllers, services, and models.

**Rationale**:
1. Separation of concerns improves code maintainability
2. Modular structure allows for easier testing
3. Clear boundaries between components simplify future modifications
4. Consistent patterns make onboarding new developers easier
5. Enables parallel development by multiple team members

**Consequences**:
* Positive: More maintainable codebase
* Positive: Easier to test individual components
* Positive: Better code organization
* Negative: Slightly more files and initial structure to set up
* Negative: May appear overly complex for simpler features

## ADR-006: Mobile-First Responsive Design

**Date**: February 20, 2025

**Status**: Accepted

**Context**: 
Students and staff will access the application from various devices including smartphones, tablets, and desktops.

**Decision**: 
Implement a mobile-first responsive design using CSS Flexbox and Grid.

**Rationale**:
1. Mobile-first approach ensures usability on smaller screens
2. CSS Flexbox and Grid provide powerful layout tools without external dependencies
3. Modern CSS features reduce need for JavaScript-based layout manipulation
4. Progressive enhancement ensures functionality across device capabilities
5. Responsive images improve performance on mobile devices

**Consequences**:
* Positive: Consistent user experience across devices
* Positive: Better accessibility
* Positive: Reduced maintenance compared to separate mobile/desktop versions
* Negative: More complex CSS structure
* Negative: More testing required across device sizes

## ADR-007: Comprehensive Logging and Monitoring

**Date**: March 1, 2025

**Status**: Accepted

**Context**: 
We need visibility into application behavior, performance, and user activities for troubleshooting and auditing.

**Decision**: 
Implement comprehensive logging with structured log formats and centralized logging storage.

**Rationale**:
1. Structured logs enable better filtering and analysis
2. Centralized logging simplifies troubleshooting
3. Different log levels allow appropriate detail for different scenarios
4. Audit logs provide traceability for student and staff actions
5. Performance metrics help identify bottlenecks

**Consequences**:
* Positive: Better visibility into system behavior
* Positive: Easier troubleshooting and debugging
* Positive: Audit trail for compliance purposes
* Negative: Increased storage requirements for logs
